#   bamazon


#   Bamazon is an Amazon like storefront that takes orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. We        used MySQL to create a database of products with item id and prices and customers are prompted with questions asking           which product they want to buy and how many and it'll check inventory to see if we have enough and then give the cost at       the end. 

#   In order to run this app, user would have to type node, followed by the filename: bamazonCustomer.js in the terminal. Then     it'll show all the products, their name and their cost to the user. After this, it'll ask user to pick the id of the       product they wish to buy, then the number of items they want. I'll give them the cost following this. Then it'll ask if        they wish to continue shopping or not, if not then it'll exit. 


#   Technologies used in the app: Node js, inquirer, mysql.
